## Why Choose Hugo?

- **Speed**: Hugo is incredibly fast, generating sites in milliseconds.
- **Flexibility**: Supports themes, shortcodes, and custom layouts.
- **Security**: No server-side processing means fewer vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

1. Install Hugo from the official website.
2. Create a new site: `hugo new site my-site`.
3. Add a theme and start creating content.
