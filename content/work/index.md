I'm a software engineering leader with more than 15 years of experience designing and developing software solutions for 
established companies and startups. I have had the pleasure to see my career evolve from being a junior contributor
to lead small teams and then lead large multidisciplinary teams of contributors.  Within those years of experience I also 
have worked on challenges with variated company sizes, tools and technologies, my focus has always been early value 
delivering and scalability.
