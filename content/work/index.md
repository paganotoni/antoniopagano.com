Iâ€™m a software engineering leader with more than 15 years of experience designing and developing software solutions for established companies and startups. I have had the pleasure of seeing my career evolve from being a junior contributor to leading small teams and then leading large multidisciplinary teams of contributors. During my experience I have worked on challenges with company sizes of all sizes, using a variety of tools and technologies. My objective is always to quickly deliver value and focus on the scalability of the products I build.
