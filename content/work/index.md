I build companies from concept to reality, overseeing everything from system architecture to engineering leadership. My deeply technical, hands-on approach was the blueprint for Wawandco and remains central to my work.

I focus on challenges where technology and human behavior intersect, developing innovative, human-centric products. This philosophy led me to co-found Symbol Security, which addresses the human element in cybersecurity. My goal is to empower people by turning complex problems into elegant, effective solutions.
