As a proud family man and software engineering leader, I find joy in balancing my professional endeavors with my personal life. As the founder of [Wawandco](https://wawand.co/) and Co-founder of [SymbolSecurity](https://symbolsecurity.com/), I'm dedicated to building successful companies. When I'm not focused on innovation and growth, you can find me cheering on my favorite sports teams or staying active through outdoor activities.
