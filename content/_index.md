I am a software engineer by trade and an entrepreneur at heart. I build teams and technology as the founder of [Wawandco](https://wawand.co/) and co-founder of [SymbolSecurity](https://symbolsecurity.com/). Beyond work, I'm a dedicated family man, an avid sports fan, and always looking for the next outdoor adventure.
