This is the repo for my personal website. In it I share some info about me and my projects.

### Tools

This is a Hugo website that uses Tailwindcss to style the html. The deployment workflow requires the tailwindcss standalone CLI to be used to compile the `assets/css/tailwind.css` file which will generate the required css in the `assets/css/styles.css` file.

### Development

To develop locally you need to have Hugo installed and NPM installed. You can follow the instructions in the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
